# uno-jar
fork of ONE-Jar with some bug fixes

Please note that I do not claim to have 100% fully understood the code, so I may be breaking things in subtle ways, 
but so far the fixes I have applied seem to have worked for me. Very happy to have comments/suggestions. The name "uno-jar"
is due to his license which forbids enorsement of my code with the trade marked name of his project.
